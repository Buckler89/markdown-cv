I obtained my PhD at the Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy. During the PhD  I worked on autonomous systems for the detection of human falls using neural networks. In this period, I have focused mainly on different neural network architectures, among which are:
- CNN
- Siamese Neural Network
- Autoencoder
and algorithms such as:
- SVC
- OCSVC
- Gaussian Mixture Model
and I have also carried out activities related to the development of IoT systems and their interoperability.
During my PhD I made several publications in journals and conferences:

After my PhD, from 2018 I started working for MFL X where I still work today. Here I dealt with exploiting exponential technologies to design and build intelligent industrial machines. In particular, I developed and managed the following projects:

- A quality control system for the production of cables protected with a sheath. We have applied and developed knowledge about neural networks in relation to the development of the algorithm. I have been involved in the selection of the camera, optical and illumination equipment as well as the hardware for the computer system. The system is based on a microservice architecture that integrates with the production line itself. I have also developed a web interface to interact with the tool (Python Flask + JavaScript + HTML + CSS). This device has also been the subject of a patent application, entitled "Method and apparatus for controlling quality of production of cables provisos of protective sheath, in particular electric cables", of which I am one of the two inventors. 
The patent is filed in the name of SEMPLICE SPA:

        Droghini, D. (2019, June 27). US20200408696A1 - Method and apparatus for checking the production quality of cables that are provided with a protective sheath, in particular electrical cables          - Google Patents. https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200408696A1/en

- Development of a web IIoT application for the monitoring of production lines offered as a SaaS. The system is based on edge devices and cloud.
The edge part is deployed on a debian based Industrial IPC with an architecture composed of a series of docker microservices.
The cloud part is multi-platform: Siemens Mindphere and Microsoft Azure.
During the project, I have been able to deepen the following topics/instrumentalities:

- Microservices based on docker and their orchestration
- CI/CD and development of related pipelines (in particular through bitbucket)
- Edge monitoring (portainer)
- Minsphere (with a good knoladge of the API and related services)
- Azure (instantiate and manage virtual machines, IoTHub, blob storage, redis cache, security, active directory, app registration).

- Development of a chatbot based on LLM (Azure OpenAI) for Q&A on manuals of idustrial machines. In this project, I have worked extensively with the following libraries/tools: Azure Cognitive Services, Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, langChain, LlamaIndex and others.

I'm familiar with software development methodologies such as Agile and Scrum. 

I know the following programming languages (in order of competence): Python, C, C++, MATLAB, JavaScript, HTML, Node.JS.

I know and have worked extensively with the following libraries/tools: Python: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Scipy, Numpy, Langchain, Pytorch, Pandas.

I have worked with the following tools/platforms/ide: Wandb, Dogshub, Azure (cli, Active Directory, blob storage, Redis cache, Iothub, Virtual Machine, Container Registry), Git, Bitbucket, GitKraken, Pycharm, VSCode.

For project management, I have used platforms like Microsoft Teams, Slack, Jira.

I have a good knowledge of the Linux and Windows platforms.

The main databases: MongoDB, SQL, InfluxDB, Parquet.
